# Analyzing-police-activity-in-Minnesota

Data from 
THE STANFORD OPEN POLICING PROJECT https://openpolicing.stanford.edu/; they also have an extensive README file.

As a reaction to all the noise around last weeks awful event, I tried contributing to this tragic topic with a more insightful approach. The data shows 675156 unique traffic stops by the police in the state of Minnesota from 2001 until 2016.

I did some explanatory analysis concerning driver race and frequency of police stops. Feel free to comment / commit changes.
